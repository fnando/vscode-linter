Features:

- Implement new linters easily with just a few lines of code.
- Ignore rules (end-of line, file, or current line).
- Fix files (depends on linter's support).
- Add links to rule's documentation.
- Linters are lazy loaded, so you won't waste computer memory with linters you
  don't use.

## Usage

Install the extension by visiting
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fnando.linter> or searching
for `fnando.linter`.

Linter will use the binary that's on your `$PATH`; if your file is not being
linted, check the "linter" output panel for additional information.

You can tweak your linters configuration by editing only the nodes you need; for
instance, to disable a linter, all you need is something like this:

```json
{
  "linter.linters": {
    "ruby": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```
